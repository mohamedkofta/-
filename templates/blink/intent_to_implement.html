<label>Describe the degree of compatibility risk you believe this change poses</label>
<span class="help">If you don't have a launch tracking bug or row in the feature dashboard, include in this email links to relevant specs, standards discussions, or documentation about support for the feature in other browsers.</span>

<label>Ongoing technical constraints</label>
<span class="help">Do you anticipate adding any ongoing technical constraints to the codebase while implementing this feature? We prefer to avoid features which require or assume a specific architecture. For most features, the answer here is "None."</span>

<label>Will this feature be supported on all five Blink platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux,
Chrome OS, and Android)? Yes or no.</label>
<span class="help">If no, explain why certain platforms will not be included in your implementation.</span>

<label>Requesting approval to ship?</label>
<span class="help">"No" - you will be implementing your feature behind a runtime flag and sending an Intent to Ship email when you're ready to enable by default.

"Yes" - your change is small and you'd like to ship enabled-by-default immediately. Per the launch process for new features, you'll need LGTMs from 3 API OWNERS before shipping. If "yes," please change the title of the email to "Intent to Implement and Ship: ...".
